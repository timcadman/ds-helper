# Introducation
dsHelper contains a number of client-side functions designed to simplify data 
manipulation and analysis using DataSHIELD. Functions are grouped in the
following families:

- Descriptive functions 
- Data manipulation functions
- Utility functions 
- Functions for trajectory models

This vignette demonstrates the first three families of function. Functions to 
assist with trajectory/mixed effect analysis are described in a separate 
tutorial.

```{r}
library(dsHelper)
library(dsBaseClient)
library(DSI)
library(DSMolgenisArmadillo)
```

# Data: simulated data based on LifeCycle variables
To demonstrate these functions we will use remote simulated data for three 
cohorts: ALSPAC, BCG & BiB.

If you are unsure how to log in, please consult the DataSHIELD vignette:

token <- armadillo.get_token("https://armadillo.test.molgenis.org")

builder <- DSI::newDSLoginBuilder()

builder$append(
server = "alspac",

ds.colnames("data")
```

# Data manipulation functions

## Rename variables with dh.renameVars()
dh.renameVars allows you to change the names of one or more variables within a 
dataframe. For example, we can rename the variables "id", and "ethnicity"
with simpler names:

```{r}
dh.renameVars(
  df = "data",
  current_names = c("ethnicity", "pat_soc"), 
  new_names = c("race", "paternal_class"))

ds.colnames("data")
```

## Removing columns with dh.dropCols()
dh.dropCols allows you to remove columns from a dataframe. The argument "type"
allows you to specify whether to remove or to keep the provided variables. For
example, we can remove the column "mat_ed":
```{r}
dh.dropCols(
  df = "data", 
  vars = "mat_ed", 
  type = "remove")

ds.colnames("data")
```

Alternatively, we can just to keep certain columns and remove everything else.
In this example we keep the columns "sex", "height_m" and "ivf":
```{r}
dh.dropCols(
  df = "data", 
  vars = c("id", "age", "sex", "weight"), 
  type = "keep")

ds.colnames("data")
```

## Creating strata of a variable with dh.makeStrata()
A common scenario is when you have repeat measurements of a variable, but
want to create individual versions of that variable within different age 
bands.

For example, you may have a dataset with repeat measurments of height between
ages 2-18. However, you want to create a new variable which is height between
ages 4-6. This is quite a long process in datashield, as it involves creating
a number of subsets. It is also necessary to deal with situations where a 
subject has >1 observation within the specified period.

In the example below, we create two variables for child height measured between 
(i) ages 4-6 and (ii) ages 7-10. Where children have more than one observation 
in either window, we opt to take the earliest measurement. This behaviour is
controlled by the argument "mult_action". You can also choose to take (i) the 
latest variable, or (ii) the variable closest to a particular time point.
Finally, within each band we choose to take values >= to the lowest band, and 
< the highest band. This behaviour is controlled by the argument "band_action".
See ?dh.makeStrata for more information on the available arguments.

In this example it runs quite quickly, however if you are using many cohorts
with large datasets it can take a considerable amount of time (30 - 60 min).

```{r}
dh.makeStrata(
  df = "data",
  var_to_subset = "weight",
  age_var = "age", 
  bands = c(4, 6, 7, 10), 
  mult_action = "earliest",
  band_action = "ge_l", 
  id_var = "id", 
  new_obj = "height_data")

ds.colnames("height_data")
```

The created dataset contains 5 variables: the id variable, two variables
giving the height value within the specified bands (height_.6, height_.10) and
two variables giving the age of measurement for these height variables (age.6,
age.10). 

We can then use ds.merge to join this dataframe back with our main data:
```{r}
ds.merge(
  x.name = "data", 
  y.name = "height_data", 
  by.x = "id", 
  by.y = "id", 
  all.x = TRUE, 
  newobj = "data")

ds.colnames("data")
```

## Transforming continuous variable to interquartile range using dh.makeIQR()
In some scenarios (e.g. when using an environmental exposures) we want to 
standardise a continuous variable by transforming it by its interquartile range. 
The formula is:

value(subject) / 75th percentile(sample) - 25th percentile(sample)

When using data from multiple cohorts there are two options for the denominator:
(i) create IQR in each cohort using the interquartile range in that cohort,
(ii) create IQR in each cohort by using the combined interquartile range
across all cohorts. This is controlled by the argument `type`.

In this example we transform child weight. The created variable will have
the suffix "iqr_c" if `type` is "separate" and "iqr_p" if type = "pooled".

```{r}
dh.makeIQR(
  df = "data",
  vars = "weight",
  type = "separate",
  new_obj = "data")

ds.colnames("data")
ds.summary("weight_iqr_c")
```

## Removing objects from workspace using dh.tidyEnv()
The DataSHIELD function `ds.rm()` allows you to remove single objects from your
workspace. However, we may want to remove a number of objects at once. Use
the argument `type` to choose whether to keep or remove the variables listed in
`vars`. Here we chose to keep "data" and remove everything else.

```{r}
dh.tidyEnv(
  obj = "data",
  type = "keep")

ds.ls()
```

## Identifying column indices using dh.findVarsIndex
There are some occasions when we need to do know what column a set of 
variables is. For example, the function ds.dataFrameSubset takes an input for 
the argument `keep.cols` a vector column positions.

Subsetting data frames by column number is highly susceptable to breaking (e.g
if you change the order of steps in a script). This function allows you to
identify the column numbers of a vector of column names, like so:

```{r}
dh.findVarsIndex(
  df = "data",
  vars = c("sex", "age", "weight")
)
```

# Describing data

## Summarising data using dh.getStats()
The DataSHIELD functions `ds.summary` and `ds.table` produce basic descriptive
statistics. However, they have a number of limitations: the output is not in a 
very useable format, you can only specify one variable at a time, and they don't
provide some information that we will likely need in manuscripts (e.g. about
missingness). 

Here we describe multiple variables using dh.getStats():

```{r}
test <- dh.getStats(
  df = "data",
  vars = c("age", "sex", "weight")
)

ds.colnames("data")

test$categorical %>% select(variable, cohort, valid_n, missing_n, perc_missing)
```

The output is a list of two tibbles, corresponding to categorical and continuous
variables. See the help file for a list of calculated figures and stats.

## Extracting model coefficients using dh.lmTab
When we run simple linear regression models in DataSHIELD, the coefficients are
returned within a nested list. It can be a bit tricky to manually extract these
(e.g. to create a table or a plot). This function extracts the coefficients
from linear models and outputs them in a tibble. It can also handle mixed-effect
models and will also return summaries of random effects.

```{r}
output <- ds.glm(formula = "weight~age", data = "data", family = "gaussian")

dh.lmTab(
  model = output, 
  type = "glm_ipd", 
  direction = "wide", 
  ci_format  = "separate")
```

For manuscripts we may want to include confidence intervals in brackets after
the point estimate. We can specify this with the argument "ci_format":

```{r}
dh.lmTab(
  model = output, 
  type = "glm_ipd", 
  direction = "wide", 
  ci_format  = "paste")
```

## Checking class of data using dh.classDiscrepancy()
In an ideal world all variables would have the same class in every study. 
However due to mistakes in harmonisation (or your scripts!) this may not be the
case. The can cause problems because many DataSHIELD functions require the input
variable(s) to have the same class in all studies. 

Using dh.classDiscrepancy we can produce a tibble summarising the class of 
variable(s) across multiple studies. If we leave the argument `vars` empty
we check the class of all variables. The column "discrepancy" summarises 
whether there are differences across studies.

```{r}
dh.classDiscrepancy(df = "data")
```

## Checking non-missing data using dh.anyData()
When we perform analyses with multiple cohorts, we may want to use the same
set of covariates in all analyses. We can use dh.anyData() to check which
cohortsh have at least some data on given variables.

```{r}
dh.anyData(
  df = "data",
  vars = c("age", "sex", "weight")
)
```

# Creating a dataset for analysis using dh.defineCases()
Before starting analysis we often want to restrict the dataset to subjects
meeting certain criteria. In the first example, we create a vector indicating
whether each subject has complete data on the set of variables age, sex and 
weight:

```{r}
dh.defineCases(
  df = "data", 
  vars = c("age", "sex", "weight"),
  type = "all", 
  new_obj = "data_on_all_vars")

ds.table("data_on_all_vars")$output.list$TABLE_rvar.by.study_counts
``` 
The data we have here is not the best to illustrate this function, as 
there is no missing data.

We can also check whether subjects have available data on *any* of a set of 
variables:
```{r}
dh.defineCases(
  df = "data", 
  vars = c("age", "sex", "weight"),
  type = "any", 
  new_obj = "data_on_any_vars")

ds.table("data_on_any_vars")$output.list$TABLE_rvar.by.study_counts
``` 
Again, we can't see the differences because all subjects have data on all
variables. However, lets assume that we want to create an subset of our data
restricted to participants with data on at least one of these variables. We 
can then use ds.dataFrameSubset in conjuncture with the vector we created:

```{r}
ds.dataFrameSubset(
  df.name = "data", 
  V1.name = "data_on_any_vars", 
  V2.name = "1", 
  Boolean.operator = "==", 
  newobj = "analysis_df")
```


# Miscellaneous functions

## Enabling auto-complete functionality within R Studio. 
When using R studio with native R, auto-complete suggestions will appear for
variables within a data frame. However, by default these won't appear for 
variables within a serverside data frame. 

We can get round this by creating a local object with the same structure as the 
remote object. Once you have run this function, autocomplete options for the
data frame "data" should now be available.

```{r}
dh.localProxy(df = "data", conns = conns)
```

## Manually pooling estimates by meta-analysis
Most of the time the meta-analysis functions in DataSHIELD (e.g. ds.glmSLMA)
will be sufficient. However, you may sometimes need additional flexibility 
with meta-analysis. For example, currently ds.glmSLMA doesn't return 
heterogeneity statistics.

This functions takes vectors of coefficients and standard errors from
multiple cohorts and meta-analyses them.

First we fit a model in different cohorts and extract the coefficients:
```{r}
output <- ds.glmSLMA(
  formula = "weight~age", 
  dataName = "data", 
  family = "gaussian")
```

Now we can use this object and to the meta-analysis manually:

```{r}
meta_analysed <- dh.metaManual(
  model = output,
  method = "ML")
```

The output consists of a list with two elements. The first element ("model") is 
a list with the output from metafor. The length will be the number of variables
meta-analysed:

```{r}
str(meta_analysed$model)
```

The second element ("coefficients") is a summary table:
```{r}
meta_analysed$coefs
```
