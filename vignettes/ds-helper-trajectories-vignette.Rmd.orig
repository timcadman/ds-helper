# Introduction

## Overview
This tutorial will demonstrate how to model trajectories in DataSHIELD using 
repeated measures data from multiple cohorts. 

This tutorial draws on the following papers/tutorials:

1. Hughes, R., Tilling, K. & Lawlor, D. Combining longitudinal data from 
different cohorts to examine the life-course trajectory. Preprint available on 
medrxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.24.20237669 

2. Tilling K, Macdonald-Wallis C, Lawlor DA, Hughes RA, Howe LD. Modelling 
childhood growth using fractional polynomials and linear splines. Ann Nutr 
Metab. 2014;65(2-3):129-38. https://doi.org/10.1159/000362695. 

3. Centre for Multilevel Modelling online course. 
http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmm/learning/online-course/

You will use simulated data to replicate part of the analysis from Hughes et al.
cited above. It would be helpful to read this tutorial in conjuncture with this 
paper.

Please note that not all the methods used in Hughes et al. are available in 
DataSHIELD. Currently it is not possible to use (i) multiple imputation, (ii)
spline models, or (iii) 1-stage meta-analysis of mixed effects models. 
All of these are in the pipeline and this tutorial will be extended when these 
methods become available.


## Data
We will be working with simulated repeated measures data for four cohorts:
(i) Alspac, (ii) BCG, (iii) Born in Bradford & (iv) Probit.


## Aims of the analysis
Our research aims for today are:

1. To model child weight trajectories over time for four cohorts
2. To model sex differences in weight trajectories
2. To combine these trajectories by 2-stage meta-analysis

Let's get started.

# Installing and loading packages
First you need to install some packages are used in tutorial. Even if
you have previously installed them it is worth doing this again to ensure
that you have the latest versions.

If prompted to update packages, select option 'none'.

First install the package 'remotes' which contains the function 'install_github'.
```{r}
install.packages("remotes")
library(remotes)
```

```{r install-packages, eval = FALSE}
install_github("datashield/DSI")
install_github("datashield/dsBaseClient", ref = "v6.2-dev")
install_github("lifecycle-project/ds-helper", ref = "traj-fun")
install.packages("DSMolgenisArmadillo")
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Now we load these packages.
```{r load-packages}
library(dsBaseClient)
library(DSI)
library(DSMolgenisArmadillo)
library(dsHelper)
library(tidyverse)
```

A couple of things to note:

1. I use a lot of the tidyverse packages as I find them very efficient
and they make the code more readable. If any syntax is unclear just ask!

2. I also use a number of functions from a package called dsHelper. This was written
by me and Sido Haakma to make analysis in DataSHIELD more straightforward. Any
problems with these functions just let us know.

# Logging in and assigning data

The simulated data is held on a remote server. To access it, you first 
request a 'token' which contains the login details. You then use this to login 
and assign the data.
```{r login}
token <- armadillo.get_token("https://armadillo.test.molgenis.org")

builder <- DSI::newDSLoginBuilder()

builder$append(
server = "alspac",
url = "https://armadillo.test.molgenis.org",
table = "mlmalspac/tutorial/data",
token = token,
driver = "ArmadilloDriver")

builder$append(
server = "bcg",
url = "https://armadillo.test.molgenis.org",
table = "mlmbcg/tutorial/data",
token = token,
driver = "ArmadilloDriver")

builder$append(
server = "bib",
url = "https://armadillo.test.molgenis.org",
table = "mlmbib/tutorial/data",
token = token,
driver = "ArmadilloDriver")

builder$append(
server = "probit",
url = "https://armadillo.test.molgenis.org",
table = "mlmprobit/tutorial/data",
token = token,
driver = "ArmadilloDriver")

logindata <- builder$build()

conns <- DSI::datashield.login(logins = logindata, assign = TRUE, symbol = "data")
```
  
We can check that this has worked. You should see that each cohort has one 
dataframe called "data", which contains 7 variables.
```{r summarise}
ds.summary("data", datasources = conns)
```
We wont be using all of the variables today, however if you want to come back 
and use this data to try out more complicated models we'll keep it online.
  
# PART 1: VISUALISING THE DATA

## Scatter plots of child weight by age
Let's start off by looking at our repeated measures weight data for each cohort.
We can make scatter plots with age on the x-axis and weight on the y-axis. 

Note that the values that you see are anonymised - they are a non-disclosive
approximation of the original values.
```{r scatter}
ds.scatterPlot(x = "data$age", y = "data$weight", datasources = conns)
```

What are you initial thoughts about the data?

## Mean observed weight by age
Another way to visualise the weight data is to split child age into yearly 
intervals, and plot the mean on the y-axis with age on the x-axis (see Figure 2 
from Hughes et al.).

First of all we need to calculate the mean values for weight at each yearly age 
band:
```{r prep-weight-age}
meanage <- dh.meanByAge(
	df = "data", 
	outcome = "weight", 
	age_var = "age", 
	conns = conns)

meanage %>% print(n = Inf)
```

Now we have the values locally, we can use any r package to plot these. I
like to use ggplot:
```{r plot-weight-age}
palette <- c("#264653", "#2a9d8f", "#E9C46A", "#F4A261", "#E76F51")

meanage.plot <- ggplot() + 
  geom_line(data = meanage, aes(x = age, y = mean, colour = cohort), size = 0.8) +
  scale_y_continuous(limit = c(0, 80), breaks = seq(0, 80, 20), expand = c(0, 0)) +
  xlab("Child age") +
  ylab("Observed weight (KG)") +
  scale_colour_manual(values = palette)

meanage.plot
```
Q: Looking at these two plots, What are your initial thoughts about the pattern of 
weight change over time?

## Describing the exposures
DataSHIELD contains the functions ds.summary and ds.table which can be used to 
describe continuous and categorical variables. However, the output of these is 
a little tricky to work with. Instead we can use the function 'dh.getStats' to 
extract descriptives in a more usable format.

```{r extract-stats}
stats <- dh.getStats(
	df = "data", 
	vars = "sex", 
	conns = conns)

stats
```
This gives us a list with two elements corresponding to the continuous and categorical
variables. As we didn't request stats for any continuous variables, the first list is 
empty.

## Some more descriptives that are useful to have
There are other bits of information it is useful to report:

- Total number of observations
- Total number of participants
- Min and max age of participants
- Median number of measurements per individual

We can use the function dh.getRmStats to extract this info. Note that the min and max
ages are based on the 5th and 95th percentiles as DataSHIELD doesn't will not return
true minimum and maximums due to disclosure issues.
```{r rm-stats}
rm_stats <- dh.getRmStats(
	df = "data",
	outcome = "weight",
	id_var = "id", 
	age_var = "age", 
	conns = conns
)

rm_stats
```

# PART 2: FITTING A SIMPLE LINEAR TRAJECTORY

## Trajectory models: prep
Before we can get started, we need to make sure that our id variable is an 
integer. If we don't, it breaks. First we create a new object which is an 
integer version of our ID. We then join this back to our main dataframe.
```{r id-integer}
ds.asInteger(
	x.name = "data$id", 
	newobj = "id_int", 
  datasources	= conns)

ds.cbind(
	x = c("data", "id_int"),
	newobj = "data", 
  datasources	= conns)
```

## Specifying the model
First we fit a model with weight predicted by four terms: an intercept (1), 
age, sex and the interaction between age and sex. These terms are our 'fixed effects', 
and comprise the first half of the formula below. They are specified in the same way as 
you would write a formula in a standard regression model.

In the second half of the formula below we specify our random effects. This is
where we provide information about how we believe the data to be clustered. 

The variable to the right of the vertical line is our ID variable. This specifies
that we want to treat each invidual as a separate cluster, because we believe 
their measurements will be correlated. This is a plausible hypothesis:
for example if my height is a lot higher than average at age 5,
it is likely to also be higher than average at age 10. We can describe this as 
a 2-level clustering, with weight measurements (level 1) clustered within individuals (level 2).

The variables to the left of the vertical line specify which extra parameters
we want to estimate for each individual. Or to put it another way, it specifies
which parameters we allow to vary for each individual.

If we just specify "1", then in addition to calculating an overall
intercept, we also calculate an intercept for each individual. This provides
us with information about the variability between individuals in their starting
weight. This is called a random intercept model.

If we specifed "1 + age", then in addition we would calculate a separate slope
for each individual. This would provide us with information about how the gradient
of the trajectory varies between individuals. This is called a random slope model.

Here we start with a random intercept model. Understand what you are doing is
the difficult bit; fitting the model is straightfoward:
```{r model-1}
model1.fit <- ds.lmerSLMA(
	dataName = "data",
  formula = "weight ~ 1 + age + sex + age*sex + (1|id_int)", 
  datasources = conns)

model1.fit$output.summary
```

## Exploring the output
We can see the coefficients for the fixed and random parts of our model
directly from the model object.

Fixed effects coefficients for each cohort are here:
```{r model1-fixed-coh}
model1.fit$betamatrix.valid
```
The pooled estimates are here:
```{r model1-pooled-coh}
model1.fit$SLMA.pooled.ests.matrix
```
And the details of the random effects are here:
```{r model1-random-coh}
model1.fit$output.summary$study1$varcor
```

## A neater way
I find these objects a little fiddly to work with (you may not). You can also 
use the dsHelper function to extract the coefficients. 
```{r model1-tab}
model1.coef <- dh.lmTab(
	model = model1.fit, 
	type = "lmer", 
	coh_names = names(conns), 
	ci_format = "separate", 
	direction = "wide"
)
```

Let's explore there in more detail

### Fixed effects
The fixed effects are analogous to your coefficients from a linear regression
model.
```{r model1-tab-fixed}
model1.coef$fixed
```
If we use dh.lmTab it allows us to manipulate our output more easily. For 
example you might want to split the fixed effects by cohort:
```{r}
model1.coef$fixed %>% group_by(cohort) %>%
group_split()
```

Or you might want to just select the pooled results:
```{r}
model1.coef$fixed %>% dplyr::filter(cohort == "combined")
```

### Random effects
When the model if fit, group (level 2) residuals are calculated for each subject.
These represent the difference between interecept of each subject and the 
mean intercept for the sample.

However, there are not returned by DataSHIELD as they could be disclosive. 
Instead we can view the standard deviation of these residuals:
```{r model1-tab-random}
model1.coef$random_sd
```

If we take ALSPAC as an example, we have an overall (mean) intercept of 3.87,
and a standard deviation of 3.84. This indicates considerable variability
between individual intercepts. If you had specified more than one random effect 
(e.g. slope) this would also be displayed here. You could also view the 
correlation between your random effects (output$random_cor).

We can also see the standard deviation of the residual error, ie the difference 
between observed values and predicted values within subject.
```{r}
model1.coef$resid_sd
```


## Plotting the trajectories
In order to plot trajectories, we first need to get model predicted values of weight. In 
order to do this, we need to create a dataframe with the values of the fixed effects
at which we want to predict values of weight. The names of the columns of this
new dataframe need to correspond to the names of the coefficients in the output
above.

We want to visualise the trajectories for both males and females between ages
0 and 25. In our reference dataframe, we therefore create values for age between
0 and 25 at 0.1 intervals, repeated for sex == 0 (males) and sex == 1 (females).
```{r}
new_data_m <- tibble(
	age = seq(0, 25, by = 0.1), 
	"age:sex1" = age*0,
	sex1 = 0)

new_data_f <- tibble(
	age = seq(0, 25, by = 0.11), 
	"age:sex1" = age*1,
	sex1 = 1)

pred_data <- bind_rows(new_data_m, new_data_f)
```

If we look at this object we have created, it has all the values of the 
model variables at which we want to predict weight:
```{r}
pred_data
```

We can then use this reference data and our model object to get predicted values.
Note that we now have four more columns appended to our reference data containing
predicted values, standard error of predictions and confidence intervals.
```{r}
plotdata <- dh.predictLmer(
	model = model1.fit,
	newdata = pred_data,
	coh_names = names(conns)
)

plotdata
```

Nice, we're getting there. One thing to address is that currently we have
predicted values for all cohorts between ages 0 and 25. However many of the cohorts
don't have data between those ages, so we might not want to plot beyond
where there is data. We can trim our predicted data to the available ages.
```{r}
plot_trim <- dh.trimPredData(
	pred = plotdata,
	coh_names = c("alspac", "bcg", "bib", "probit", "combined"),
	min = rep(0, 5), 
	max = c(20, 5, 5, 20, 20)
)
```

Next we set sex as a factor to make the plot clearer:
```{r}
plot_trim <- plot_trim %>%
mutate(sex = factor(sex1, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("Male", "Female")))
```

It would also be nice to be able to overlay the predicted trajectory with 
the observed values. Remember earlier we made a scatter plot using DataSHIELD? 
We can extract the anonymised values which were used in that plot and store them 
as a local object. This allows us to build more flexible plots.

Each row of the created object represents the anomyised values of a subject.
```{r}
observed <- dh.getAnonPlotData(
	df = "data",
	v1 = "age", 
	v2 = "weight", 
	conns = conns
)

observed
```

Now we are ready to plot the pooled trajectories. We use the function
"sample_frac" to only take 1% of the observed values. You can play around with
this value, but if you use too many the graph becomes unreadable.
```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(
  	data = sample_frac(observed, .01) %>% filter(cohort == "combined"), 
  	aes(x = age, y = weight), 
  	alpha = 0.4, 
  	size = 0.1) +
  geom_line(
  	data = plot_trim %>% filter(cohort == "combined"), 
  	aes(x = age, y = predicted, colour = sex), size = 0.8) +
  geom_ribbon(
  	data = plot_trim %>% filter(cohort == "combined" & sex == "Male"), 
  	aes(x = age, ymin = low_ci, ymax = upper_ci), alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_ribbon(
  	data = plot_trim %>% filter(cohort == "combined" & sex == "Female"), 
  	aes(x = age, ymin = low_ci, ymax = upper_ci), alpha = 0.1) +
  scale_x_continuous(limit = c(0, 20), breaks = seq(0, 20, 5), expand = c(0, 0)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(limit = c(0, 80), breaks = seq(0, 80, 20), expand = c(0, 0)) +
  xlab("Child age") +
  ylab("Predicted weight (KG)") +
  labs(colour = "Sex")
```

We can also plot the trajectories for each cohort separately:
```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(
  	data = sample_frac(observed, .01) %>% filter(cohort != "combined"), 
  	aes(x = age, y = weight), 
  	alpha = 0.4, 
  	size = 0.1) +
  geom_line(
  	data = plot_trim %>% filter(cohort != "combined"), 
  	aes(x = age, y = predicted, colour = sex), size = 0.8) +
  geom_ribbon(
  	data = plot_trim %>% filter(cohort != "combined" & sex == "Male"), 
  	aes(x = age, ymin = low_ci, ymax = upper_ci), alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_ribbon(
  	data = plot_trim %>% filter(cohort != "combined" & sex == "Female"), 
  	aes(x = age, ymin = low_ci, ymax = upper_ci), alpha = 0.1) +
  facet_wrap(~cohort) +
  scale_x_continuous(limit = c(0, 20), breaks = seq(0, 20, 5), expand = c(0, 0)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(limit = c(0, 80), breaks = seq(0, 80, 20), expand = c(0, 0)) +
  xlab("Child age") +
  ylab("Predicted weight (KG)") +
  labs(colour = "Sex")
```

Q: Looking at the plots, how well do you think our model fits the data?

# PART 3: FITTING A NON-LINEAR TRAJECTORY USING A TRANSFORMATION OF THE AGE TERM
The previous model doesn't look great to me, especially around age 5 where 
there looks to be a distinct non-linearity in the trajectory which we are not 
capturing.

One way to address this is to model weight not as a function of age, but as a
function of a transformation of age.

Let's start by creating a new variable which is age^2, and see if this provides
a better fit. We create the variable, and join it back in our main data frame.
```{r}
ds.make(
	toAssign = "data$age^2", 
	newobj = "age_2", 
	datasources = conns
)

ds.dataFrame(
	x = c("data", "age_2"), 
	newobj = "data", 
	datasources = conns
)
```
Now we are going to simply repeat the steps before, but using this transformed
variable instead of the original age variable.

First we run the model:
```{r}
age_2.fit <- ds.lmerSLMA(
	dataName = "data",
  formula = "weight ~ 1 + age_2 + sex + age_2*sex + (1|id_int)", 
  datasources = conns)
```

Now we create a dataframe of the values of the fixed effects at which we want
to predict weight. Note that as we have transformed our age term, we need to add 
this transformed version of the variable to our reference data.
```{r}
pred_ref_2a <- tibble(
	age = seq(0, 25, by = 0.1), 
	age_2 = age^2,
	"age_2:sex1" = age_2*0,
	sex1 = 0)

pred_ref_2b <- tibble(
	age = seq(0, 25, by = 0.11), 
	age_2 = age^2,
	"age_2:sex1" = age_2*1,
	sex1 = 1)

pred_ref_2 <- bind_rows(pred_ref_2a, pred_ref_2b)
```

Again we get the predicted values, trim them at the ages of the observed
data and set sex as a factor.
```{r}
pred_data_2 <- dh.predictLmer(
	model = age_2.fit,
	newdata = pred_ref_2,
	coh_names = names(conns)
)

pred_data_2_trim <- dh.trimPredData(
	pred = pred_data_2,
	coh_names = c("alspac", "bcg", "bib", "probit", "combined"),
	min = rep(0, 5), 
	max = c(20, 5, 5, 20, 20)
)

pred_data_2_trim <- pred_data_2_trim %>%
mutate(sex = factor(sex1, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("Male", "Female")))
```

Let's plot this against the observed data and see if it fits any better:
```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(
  	data = sample_frac(observed, .01) %>% filter(cohort == "combined"), 
  	aes(x = age, y = weight), 
  	alpha = 0.4, 
  	size = 0.1) +
  geom_line(
  	data = pred_data_2_trim %>% filter(cohort == "combined"), 
  	aes(x = age, y = predicted, colour = sex), size = 0.8) +
  scale_x_continuous(limit = c(0, 20), breaks = seq(0, 20, 5), expand = c(0, 0)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(limit = c(0, 80), breaks = seq(0, 80, 20), expand = c(0, 0)) +
  xlab("Child age") +
  ylab("Predicted weight") +
  labs(colour = "Sex")
```
Hmmm. We now have a non-linear trajectory, but it still doesn't look a great fit.
We haven't looked at any fit statistics or residuals yet, but from the eye it 
clearly doesn't fit the data. It also doesn't seem to capture the sex differences
we would expect. We can do better than this.

# PART 4: FRACTIONAL POLYNOMIALS
Using one transformation of age allowed one 'bend' in the trajectory. However,
the problem we saw with the previous model is that natural growth 
trajectories often have multiple bends. 

One way to model this is to use two transformations of age (e.g. age^2 and age^0.5).
These are called fractional polynomials (powers which involve fractions). You could
use more than 2 transformations: this would give you a better model fit, but with
greater risk of overfitting your model. Here we will stick two. 

Even with only two transformations of age, there are infinite number of 
possible combinations. How do we chose which to use?

You may have a good a priori reason to chose a combination of terms. If you
don't, one reasonable approach is to select a certain set of transformations,
and fit every combination of those. We can then see which combination of age
terms provides the best model fit.

## Preparing the data for modelling

### Remove values of zero
Transforming values of zero will create infinite values which will break our 
models. We add a small quantity to our age variable to avoid this.

```{r add-small-value-to-age}
ds.assign(
	toAssign = "data$age+0.01", 
	newobj = "age", 
  datasources = conns)

dh.dropCols(
	df = "data", 
	vars = "age", 
	type = "remove", 
	new_df_name = "data", 
  conns = conns)

ds.cbind(
	x = c("data", "age"), 
	newobj = "data", 
  datasources = conns)
```

### Create transformations of age term

We could do the transformations manually, but this would be a bit cumbersome. 
We can insted use the function ds.makeAgePolys to create transformations of age.
Here we use the following powers: -2, -1, -0.5, log, 0.5, 2, 3. 
```{r make-polys}
dh.makeAgePolys(
	df = "data", 
	agevars = "age", 
	poly_names = c("m_2", "m_1", "m_0_5", "log", "0_5", "2", "3"), 
	poly_form = c("^-2", "^-1", "^-0.5", "log", "^0.5", "^2", "^3"))
```

We can check this has worked, and see the mean values for these new variables.
```{r check-polys}
poly_summary <- dh.getStats(
	df = "data", 
	vars = c("agem_2", "agem_1", "agem_0_5", "logage", "age0_5", "age2", "age3")) 

poly_summary$continuous %>%
select(cohort, variable, mean, std.dev) %>%
print(n = Inf)
```

## Identifying the best fitting model
Ok, so now we have a load of transformations of our age in term in the dataframe
"data". Next we want to fit models for each paired combination of these terms.
Again, we could do this by writing out ds.lmerSLMA 28 times, but this brings 
a fair chance that you make an error in the code.

I've written a couple more functions to streamline the process. 

### Create model formulae
'dh.makeLmerForm' creates the model formulae based on the age terms you have created. 
The argument to "agevars" is a vector of variable names corresponding to the age 
transformations we created above.

First we try to find the best shape of trajectory, so we create model formulae
just with the age terms.
```{r make-formula, results = TRUE}
weight_form <- dh.makeLmerForm(
  outcome = "weight", 
  idvar = "id_int", 
  agevars = c("age", "agem_2", "agem_1", "agem_0_5", "logage", "age0_5", "age2", "age3"), 
  random = "intercept")

This has created a table where each row (a total of 28) contains the 
formula for a mixed effects model with a different combination of the 
fractional polynomials. 

## Fit all combinations of polynomials
The function dh.lmeMultPoly takes as an input to the argument "formulae" a 
vector of formulae. Here we use the formulae created above. You could also create
your own vector of formulae and supply it to the same argument. 

If you've read Rachel Hughes' paper, you'll notice that she first fits models on a
discovery sample, and then checks the fit on the remaining sample. I've 
skipped this here for simplicity but it is possible to do this in DS.

This will take a few minutes as we are fitting 28 different models.
```{r sample-a-fit}
poly.fit <- dh.lmeMultPoly(
	df = "data",
	formulae = weight_form$formulae, 
  poly_names = weight_form$polys)
```

There are some converegence warnings. We can see details here:
```{r}
poly.fit$convergence
```

The output contains a table with the negative log likelihood for each model in
each study, the average rank of that model across all studies and
the summed negative log likelihood. The model with the lowest summed 
log-likelhood across studies contains two powers: age^0.5 & age^2.
```{r show-sample-a-fit, results = TRUE}
poly.fit$fit
```

In this scenario we are trying to fit the same model to all cohorts. In other scenarioes
you might want to fit a different model to different cohorts. You could still
use this table as a reference for the best fitting model, for example for
alspac:

```{r}
poly.fit$fit %>%
select(model, alspac) %>%
arrange(desc(alspac))
```

## Final model
Ok, so we've got an idea what the best fitting combination of age terms will be.
Now we can fit our final model, including sex and the interaction with the age
terms. We aren't worrying about other covariates in this example, but of course
you could include them.
```{r}
final.fit <- ds.lmerSLMA(
	dataName = "data",
  formula = "weight ~ 1 + age0_5 + age2 + sex + age0_5*sex + age2*sex + (1|id_int)")
```

## Making plots
Now we can go through the same process as above to make our plot. Again, we 
need to create our age transformations in the new data to get the predicted
values for weight at each age.

```{r}
pred_ref_final_m <- tibble(
	age = seq(0, 25, by = 0.1), 
	age0_5 = age^0.5,
	age2 = age^2, 
	sex1 = 0,
	"age0_5:sex1" = age0_5*sex1, 
  "age2:sex1" = age2*sex1)

pred_ref_final_f <- tibble(
	age = seq(0, 25, by = 0.1), 
	age0_5 = age^0.5,
	age2 = age^2, 
	sex1 = 1,
	"age0_5:sex1" = age0_5*sex1, 
  "age2:sex1" = age2*sex1)

pred_ref_final <- bind_rows(pred_ref_final_m, pred_ref_final_f)
```

Again we get the predicted values, trim them at the ages of the observed
data and set sex as a factor.
```{r}
pred_ref_final <- dh.predictLmer(
	model = final.fit,
	newdata = pred_ref_final,
	coh_names = names(conns)
)

pred_ref_final_trim <- dh.trimPredData(
	pred = pred_ref_final,
	coh_names = c("alspac", "bcg", "bib", "probit", "combined"),
	min = rep(0, 5), 
	max = c(20, 5, 5, 20, 20)
)

pred_ref_final_trim <- pred_ref_final_trim %>%
mutate(sex = factor(sex1, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("Male", "Female")))
```

And now we can make some plots
```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(
  	data = sample_frac(observed, .01) %>% filter(cohort == "combined"), 
  	aes(x = age, y = weight), 
  	alpha = 0.4, 
  	size = 0.1) +
  geom_line(
  	data = pred_ref_final_trim %>% filter(cohort == "combined"), 
  	aes(x = age, y = predicted, colour = sex), size = 0.8) +
  geom_ribbon(
  	data = pred_ref_final_trim %>% filter(cohort == "combined" & sex == "Male"), 
  	aes(x = age, ymin = low_ci, ymax = upper_ci), alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_ribbon(
  	data = pred_ref_final_trim %>% filter(cohort == "combined" & sex == "Female"), 
  	aes(x = age, ymin = low_ci, ymax = upper_ci), alpha = 0.1) +
  scale_x_continuous(limit = c(0, 20), breaks = seq(0, 20, 5), expand = c(0, 0)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(limit = c(0, 80), breaks = seq(0, 80, 20), expand = c(0, 0)) +
  xlab("Child age") +
  ylab("Predicted weight (KG)") +
  labs(colour = "Sex")
 ```

We can also plot the trajectories by cohort
```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(
  	data = sample_frac(observed, .01) %>% filter(cohort != "combined"), 
  	aes(x = age, y = weight), 
  	alpha = 0.4, 
  	size = 0.1) +
  geom_line(
  	data = pred_ref_final_trim %>% filter(cohort != "combined"), 
  	aes(x = age, y = predicted, colour = sex), size = 0.8) +
  geom_ribbon(
  	data = pred_ref_final_trim %>% filter(cohort != "combined" & sex == "Male"), 
  	aes(x = age, ymin = low_ci, ymax = upper_ci), alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_ribbon(
  	data = pred_ref_final_trim %>% filter(cohort != "combined" & sex == "Female"), 
  	aes(x = age, ymin = low_ci, ymax = upper_ci), alpha = 0.1) +
  facet_wrap(~cohort) +
  scale_x_continuous(limit = c(0, 20), breaks = seq(0, 20, 5), expand = c(0, 0)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(limit = c(0, 80), breaks = seq(0, 80, 20), expand = c(0, 0)) +
  xlab("Child age") +
  ylab("Predicted weight (KG)") +
  labs(colour = "Sex")
```

Great, this looks like a much better fit. We have captured the initial growth,
followed by a reduction in growth rate at age 5 followed by an increase into
adolescence.

This model still isn't perfect - looking at the graph what problem can you see?

# Checking model fit
The final step is to check how well the model fits at different age points. Here 
we can approximate Table 2 from Tilling et al. (2014) "Modelling Childhood 
Growth ...". 

First we get mean observed values for weight between different age bands.
The 'intervals' argument specifies how we want to bin our age variable. Again 
this takes a few minutes to run.
```{r}
observed_by_age <- dh.meanByAge(
	df = "data", 
	outcome = "weight", 
	age_var = "age", 
	intervals = c(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 15, 16, 18)
)

observed_by_age
```

We rename our column to 'observed':
```{r}
obs <- observed_by_age %>%
dplyr::rename(observed = mean)
```

Now we get the average predicted values between the same age bands
```{r}
pred_by_age <- pred_ref_final_trim %>%
mutate(
	group = case_when(
		age > 0 & age <= 1 ~ "0_1", 
		age >= 1 & age <= 2 ~ "1_2", 
		age >= 3 & age <= 5 ~ "3_5", 
		age >= 6 & age <= 10 ~ "6_10", 
		age >= 11 & age <= 15 ~ "11_15", 
		age >= 16 & age <= 18 ~ "16_18")
		) %>%
dplyr::filter(!is.na(group)) %>%
group_by(group, cohort) %>%
summarise(
	predicted = round(mean(predicted), 2),
	low_ci = round(mean(low_ci), 2),
	upper_ci = round(mean(upper_ci), 2))

pred_by_age
```

Finally we join the observed and predicted values into one table, and calculate
the difference between the two. We can also use the confidence intervals to
calculate upper and lower bounds of the residual. You can see that model fit 
isn't great for PROBIT towards the extremes. For other cohorts, the looks pretty
good.
```{r residuals-e}
res_tab <- left_join(obs, pred_by_age, by = c("group", "cohort")) %>%
mutate(
	difference = round(observed - predicted, 2),
	lower_res = round(observed - upper_ci, 2),
	higher_res = round(observed - low_ci, 2),
	group = factor(
		group, 
		levels = c("0_1", "1_2", "3_5", "6_10", "11_15", "16_18"),
		ordered = TRUE), 
	limits = paste0(lower_res, " to ", higher_res)) %>%
filter(!is.na(predicted)) %>%
dplyr::select(group, cohort, observed, predicted, difference, limits) %>%
arrange(group) %>%
group_by(cohort) %>%
group_split %>%
set_names(names(conns))

res_tab
```
