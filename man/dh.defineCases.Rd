\description{
At some point in the analysis you will want to subset your dataset to contain
only subjects meeting some criteria, e.g. data on at least one outcome or
data on all exposures. This function speeds things up by indicating whether a subject
has non-missing values for any or all of a set of given variables.
}
\details{
Note this function replaces the deprecated dh.subjHasData.
